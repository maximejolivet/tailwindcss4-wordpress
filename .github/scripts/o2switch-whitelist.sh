# Whitelists the current GitHub Actions runner's IP for SSH (port 22) on
# o2switch (cPanel), removing the two most recently whitelisted addresses
# first — o2switch caps the whitelist size, and every CI run adds a new IP
# with nothing removing old ones on its own, so the quota fills up after a
# few runs and blocks SSH entirely (see .claude/DEPLOY.md §5.2).
#
# Known trade-off: "remove the last 2 entries" assumes they're stale CI
# runner IPs. The o2switch API this endpoint wraps has no per-entry label
# to distinguish a CI-added IP from one whitelisted by hand (e.g. via
# `make deploy` from a developer machine) — if a human IP got whitelisted
# right before a CI run, it could get swept up here. Accepted as a known
# limitation rather than adding state-tracking (a GitHub Actions cache
# entry per whitelisted IP) for a narrow edge case.
#
# Required env vars: CPANEL_USER, CPANEL_PASSWORD, CPANEL_HOST, RUNNER_IP
